This folder (and the neighboring css/ folder) contain Fluid Springboard files.

What are the Fluid Springboards?
---------------------------------
The springboards are HTML and CSS sample files bundled with the Fluid Framework download.
These files are very much like demos yet they offer a little extra information, like
semantic markup and clean CSS techniques. 

Do I have to use the approach shown in the springboards?
---------------------------------
Absolutely not. However, the springboards are meant to be a good pointer towards best
practices for a particular situation and design pattern.

For example: If you want to use the Reorderer for content in columns, instead of
using a table and table cells for your layout you might want to consider using our purely
CSS example as a starting point instead, and tweak that to your needs.
