The central question was: what sort of research can and should inform such policy? These questions arise in a particular context in which policy makers and educational researchers are increasingly vocal in their demands that educational policy and practice should be informed by high quality research. The authors set out to ask, first what in general we might say about the sort of knowledge which might be needed to inform educational policy. Can we derive useful insight from small scale case studies and personal narratives as well as large population studies, from practitioner research as well as academic institutional research, from philosophical enquiry and literary imagination as well as from empirical evidence? If so, how, more specifically do these forms of enquiry relate to and inform policy?"

Among these are the need, expressed by policy-makers, for practical evidence about what works, and the demand, exemplified by the new ESRC guidelines for research training, that all researchers learn something about techniques of analysis involving numbers. At the same time, however, traditional \'quantitative\' approaches are facing a major upheaval caused by growing criticism of null hypothesis significance testing (NHSTs), the increasing availability of high quality numeric datasets, and the development of more and more complex forms of statistical analysis. This paper shows how a re- consideration of the nature and function of probabilities (or uncertainties) in research suggests a new approach to research training that will be more appropriate than traditional courses on statistics for all learners, and that will help researchers explain their findings to policy-makers."

				"There is now a baffling array of different approaches advertised and practised in educational research. The days are long gone when the main internal divisions were marked by the disciplines, each adopting one major methodological approach. Now, the disciplines have become less salient, and are in any case themselves internally diverse",
				"so that what we have is a large and complex field in which work of sharply different kinds is carried out, accompanied by debates in which a disparate collection of theoretical and methodological labels are deployed. This paper presents the different models of science that have dominated social and educational research during the twentieth century, and uses the concept of \u201A\u00C4\u00F2paradigm\u201A\u00C4\u00F4 to analyse the set of philosophical assumptions underlying the methodological diversity within social and educational research. The author describes a selection of philosophical concepts that are used in the methodological literature, examining concepts such as empiricism, epistemology, phenomenology, positivism and postmodernism. He also summarises different classifications or typologies of methodological approaches in social and educational research, and provides a typology that distinguishes between positivist/post-positivist, interpretivist/hermeneutic, \u201A\u00C4\u00F2critical\u201A\u00C4\u00F4, and constructionist orientations."

The author affirms that regression techniques are useful, fascinating, and need to be clearly understood by a range of researchers, practitioners and policy-makers. However, like other techniques, they can give very misleading results and are, therefore, better used in combination with other methods. This article is useful for those researchers who are not that familiar with regression analyses but who are often reading research that has employed such a statistical technique."

			"description" : "In common with all forms of research which involve the study of human beings educational research raises questions as to (i) the obligations which are properly imposed on a researcher out of respect for the interests or rights of participants in the research and out of care for them as persons, but also, and especially where the researcher is investigating people in positions of power, (ii) the rights and obligations of the researcher in the service of wider public and academic understanding. We have to ask: what are these obligations? And, in a slightly more philosophical vein, how can we determine what they are? How do we know? By reference to what broader considerations can we resolve competing claims? This is, broadly speaking, the terrain of research ethics, which these resources will be seeking to discuss and to inform. These resources discuss concepts such as ethics, meta-ethics, professional ethics, and academic virtue. They also examine examples of ethical codes and research protocols, and issues related to confidentiality, anonymity, privacy, accountability and public responsibility."

			"description" : "Recent times have seen what has been described as a narrative and auto/biographical turn within the social sciences. This \'turn\', which is associated with post-modernism and a concomitant lack of faith in grand, master, or meta narratives, has had fundamental and far-reaching implications for all aspects of the research process and for how researchers conceptualise the ways in which they make sense of, and re-present, the social world. Since the early 1980s, auto/biographical and narrative approaches have come to be increasingly popular with researchers working within the field of education and, inevitably, therefore, they are well represented in the Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP) portfolio. In this resource, examples of the use of these approaches in different TLRP projects are presented and analysed. The author conclude that without exception though, TLRP projects use auto/biographical approaches that are concerned to locate the individual in the wider social, cultural and historical contexts they inhabit, and which use sociological or psychological theory as interpretational and explanatory tools"

There are several references in the text to sources that teach the practicalities perfectly well, and the technique is anyway similar to other forms of regression and to analysis of variance. Rather, the paper describes what multi\u2013level modelling is, why it is used, and what its limitations are. It does so in the hope that some readers will be enthused sufficiently to become appropriately critical \u2018consumers\u2019 of research using this approach, so building research capacity, and easing pressures on \u2018specialist\u2019 reviewers. Anyone who can read or perform standard multivariate analyses can understand, referee, or conduct a multi\u2013level model. Additionally, the paper makes three key points. The generally small sample size in each cluster at the lowest level of any multi\u2013level model means that there is a danger of a greater bias in the results than in standard analyses that pool the data from all clusters. Even where there are genuine gains through the use of multi\u2013level models these have to be set against a loss in simple intuitive grasp of the results, especially amongst policy\u2013makers and practitioners. Therefore, long term, we are probably better advised to improve our research designs and the quality of the data we collect than to focus on more and more complex forms of analysis to overcome deficiencies in the datasets we already have."

Different methods cannot be judged as intrinsically better or worse for analysing talk, at least in abstract terms: any method can only be judged by how well it serves the investigative interests of a researcher, how adequately it embodies the researcher\u201A\u00C4\u00F4s underlying theory of communication and is compatible with their beliefs about what constitutes valid empirical evidence. One approach, which has been used in several ESRC projects, is Sociocultural Discourse Analysis, which is described in this resource. This approach, based on sociocultural theory, applied to study how talk is used for teaching and learning in classrooms. It differs from most other ways of analysing talk by being concerned not only with the processes of classroom interaction, but also with their educational outcomes. Aspects related to data collection and analysis are presented and discussed."

			"description" : [
				"Education as an essential aspect of human life, its institutions, its practices, its policies, can be studied in a variety of ways. In recent decades institutionalised research into education tends to have been dominated by certain assumptions, and these have been adopted in more or less narrow ways: commonly it is assumed that such research must be empirical in character",
				"sometimes it is taken to be in service of educational institutions such as schools, to find ways for them to more effective or to be improved",
				"sometimes the view is expressed that educational research should model itself on medical research. Yet all of these assumptions lose sight of the fact that over more than two millennia there has been systematic enquiry into education of a quite different kind. Such enquiry has been influential not only for policy and practice but for the ways that whole civilisations have understood themselves. In order to gain an understanding of these issues, philosophical enquiry into education takes place. Section (i) provides tools for carrying out conceptual analysis of terms used to describe our world. Section (ii) analyses two matters that lie behind most questions about education: the nature of the good life and how we learn to lead it",
				"and the nature of knowledge and how we come to know. It is argued that it is the response to these concerns that characterises the great visions of education that have come down to us. Brief accounts of examples of such visions are presented in this section. Enquiry into these matters inevitably involves questions of justification and value, and in this sense questions of education are ethical through and through. This surely is the territory of philosophy. But this is often done in a haphazard way and without careful and systematic attention to the ways that such questions have been handled in the past, to the arguments and modes of approach that have been developed, and to the literatures in which these are embodied. An indication of these different literatures, with an important caveat, is to be found in section (iii)."

Practitioner research is often used as an umbrella term for a large number of research-based activities undertaken in the fields of practice in education and social and health care. It implies that practitioners will learn from their research into practice, which is not always the case in other forms of research. It also aims at improving rather than proving as an approach to research. These resources offer a selection of references on methods for carrying out practitioner research, and a description of a variety of initiatives where practitioners undertake research. It also highlights two important issues, ethics and quality, that must be addressed in any consideration of practitioner research."

They are designed to show some of the theoretical and empirical resources I have drawn on in my work, and to explain why these are important to me. The pages are separated into two sections: theoretical and empirical sources. This is because both are extremely significant for this kind of study. The division is not so much between where I get theoretical ideas and how I then apply them to research, as between the kind of writing I access in each. Most of what I do ends up involving the development of theory about gender. The Empirical Sources sections therefore focus on some of the places I look to get access to other people\'s research findings. Because space is limited here, I have chosen to concentrate on the two key areas of theory that I have used recently (gender theory and communities of practice), and on three empirical foci that are relatively unusual in the sociological study of gender and children (children\'s bodies, children and space, and psychological literature)"

Third, techniques and discussions related to systematic reviews and meta-analysis, as tools for the generation of evidence to inform decision making in policy and practice, are synthesised. Finally, this resource lists bibliography on issues related to building a research career and contract research staff."

			"description" : "Educational research in the UK has for some time been criticised in terms of both its relevance and its quality. Indeed, these issues of relevance and quality have been presented by critics as somehow linked with each other, and with a dearth of large-scale \'quantitative\' evidence about teaching and learning. It is, therefore, interesting to consider the recent Hay/McBer research into teacher effectiveness, one of many responses, in the light of these criticisms. To what extent has the work used quantitative evidence in a high quality piece of research to address relevant issues for practitioners and policy-makers? The answers presented in this brief account of the research are that it is clearly important work, uses a variety of numeric and other data sources, but that the design is not one that the research community should set out to emulate. Despite considerable prior adjustment to the sample, in favour of the publicised findings, it remains the case that only 55% of the teachers rated \'outstanding\' in a dichotomous classification by Hay/McBer actually achieved pupil-results higher than would be expected (once prior attainment and contextual variables were taken into account). This success rate in identification is insufficiently better than would occur by chance for the researchers to then present the characteristics of these supposedly outstanding teachers as ones that other teachers should take note of. If this report is being presented by the DfEE as the form of research that they and other client bodies are seeking, then we must conclude that quality is linked neither to research relevance, nor is it necessarily an outcome of the use of quantitative evidence per se."

In it he discusses the importance of generating actionable knowledge. Elliott goes on to briefly outline the development of such an approach in education before addressing a number of challenges, such as the place of practitioner research. In his view, applied research in education is best characterised by the intention to link research with action in a form that generates actionable knowledge. This intention is evidenced in the processes of designing, carrying out, and validating the research findings. It need not necessarily imply a preference for a particular type of knowledge or the methodology associated with its production. In this respect his answer to the question of \u2018what is applied research?\u2019 is post-paradigmatic. It is educational practitioners or policymakers who ultimately determine the extent to which knowledge outcomes are actionable within their particular action contexts."

However, in health promotion, the value of the RCT research design has been hotly disputed. Health promotion in schools is interested in using medical approaches within educational settings. Therefore it may provide lessons for the TLRP in which all projects involve some form of intervention, and most involve combining approaches. Interventions are most likely to be successful if they are based on sound theoretical concepts, and are complex and of sufficient intensity, reinforced at multiple levels and through multiple channels."

			"description" : "Educational research in the UK has for some time been criticised in terms of both its relevance and its quality. Indeed, these issues of relevance and quality have been presented by some critics as linked with each other. One way forward that has been suggested is greater political (and thereby user and practitioner) control of research and its funding. This would presumably ensure the immediate practical relevance of future work, encourage flexibility of approach, and remove some responsibility from the \'dead-hand\' of academic departments of educational research. This paper considers some of the counter-arguments, and contrary evidence, to this approach. It presents examples of projects by teachers, a large-scale study of teacher effectiveness contracted to consultants by the DfEE (as it then was), and of political self-censorship by intellectual fields. On this basis the paper suggests that the link between quality and relevance in research has been exaggerated, and that increasing political control of academic research alone is unlikely to lead to a marked improvement in quality."

Recent UK initiatives, perhaps most prominently the new funding arrangements for ESRC PhD students, have been designed to encourage a wider awareness of statistical techniques among social scientists. While welcome, there is a consequent danger for educational research that we simply revisit all of the debates about statistics that have taken place in other disciplines since at least 1994. Part of what this article tries to do is show that standard approaches to significance testing, currently the cornerstone of many \u2018quantitative\u2019 methods courses, should no longer have automatic pride of place. There is a pressing need for more general awareness of the relatively simple role of numbers in those common social scientific situations for which probabilities are not relevant."

The value of a network can come not only from the information we get from the network, but also from who we know. Networking can involve the spread of the tacit knowledge that resides within practitioner communities. This links to the importance of finding ways to move from tacit to explicit forms of knowledge development and transfer. Combining who we know and what we know can have powerful effects. Networking offers opportunities to expand knowledge and contacts, through the development and maintenance of good personal relationships, active communication and the sharing of certain information, values and beliefs. Networks can also act as a source of support and encouragement. This resource provides tools for those interested in these ideas for research purposes. Social network analysis is presented as an approach that focuses on investigating the relationships among individuals and groups, where social reality is conceptualised in terms of networks of social relationships occupying a wider social space. It also offers resources related to social capital, as social networks are a core element of the concept."

				"This set of resources indentifies several distinct ethical principles or issues involved in carrying out educational research. These principles do not exhaust all of the ethical concerns relevant to educational research, but they are probably the main ones: a) Harm: is a research strategy likely to cause harm, and is there any way in which such harm could be justified or excused? b) Autonomy: does the research process display respect for people in the sense of allowing them to make decisions for themselves, notably about whether or not to participate? c) Privacy: what should and should not be made public in research? d) Reciprocity: what, if anything, should participants reasonably expect in return from researchers",
				"and what should researchers offer them? e) Equity: it may be argued that the various individuals and groups that a researcher comes into contact with in the course of research should be treated equally, in the sense that no-one is unjustly favoured or discriminated against. The authors outline several potential sources of disagreement among the principles, and argue that each of the five principles can be subject to somewhat different interpretations that are open to dispute, depending on the people involved, the research aims and strategies, and the context in which it is carried out. They point out that judgments about what is and is not ethical practice must depend upon what is taken to be the goal of educational research, who is its audience, and how it is intended to relate to policy or practice. These resources also provide a selective bibliography on ethics and ethical regulation in educational and social research, and a selection of philosophical literature on ethics generally."

These are the sorts of questions that have been pursued in the TLRP Thematic Seminar Series, Contexts, communities, networks: Mobilizing learners\u2019 resources and relationships in different domains. This article reviews some of the positions and issues arising from the Series, focusing on the questions of what constitutes a learning context and how the relationship between learning and context can best be conceptualized. These are not new questions. Chaiklin and Lave (1996) suggest that all practices are contextualized and involve learning, but how those practices are conceptualized is more contentious. The Series drew upon situated learning theory, activity theory, actor-network theory, complexity theory and pragmatism to explore issues in relation to learning across the life course."

Analyses of these data have the potential to radically improve the robustness and generalisability of educational research In this resource the authors summarise the key messages that emerged from a series of workshops around the theme of using large-scale data sets in education research, funded by the Teaching and Learning Research Programme (Section: key findings). The purpose of the workshops was to encourage and facilitate education researchers in their use of such data and to highlight any difficulties researchers have encountered when trying to access and use such data. The authors also highlight the particular strengths and weaknesses of a select number of specific data sets with regard to their use in educational research (Section: important data sets). They then illustrate these themes in the context of research into adult learning (Section: the case of adult learning). Lastly, they conclude with a series of recommendations about how large scale data sets might be more effectively used in education research, attempting to also identify the barriers that currently prevent researchers from using these data (Section: next steps)."

Realism explicitly rejects the positivist doctrines of (Humean) causality, \u201Cpredictive\u201D explanation, conceptual nominalism, and measurement operationalism that continue to underpin much, although not all, quantitative research. However, in his view, realism does not hold any prejudice against quantification and endorses moderate empiricism."

Currently there are over 20 packages available which help researchers manage their data in different ways. This article covers the most popular of these and is intended as a helpful and critical guide to differentiate between software packages."

It starts with a rehearsal of the current poor public image of UK educational research, and some of the possible reasons for that. This rehearsal includes consideration of the limitations in some examples of influential work by established researchers. The paper continues with a summary of the reasons for using secondary data, and one example of a project based solely on secondary data. It concludes that the purportedly poor quality of some UK educational research, allied to the potential of secondary data, might actually empower novice researchers, enabling them to critique established work and to conduct powerful and informative analyses of their own."

Finally, readers will need to see how data become \u2018findings\u2019 with clear links between the analytical commentary and the evidence presented."

These include models for Bayesian syntheses, new political arithmetic, complex interventions, and design experiments, as well as the more usual literature review and \'new\' realism. I argue here that none of these approaches pose insurmountable epistemological or technical problems. Rather, opposition to the use of such models stems from wasteful \'paradigm\' wars fed perhaps by fear of the unknown, and leading to pointless methodological schism. The \'compleat\' researcher should presumably be prepared to find, use and critique all evidence relevant to their quest, regardless of its form."

The objective of combining (qualitative and/or quantitative) research studies faces no different challenges, Godfrey argues, than those faced in the field of statistics."

			"description" : "Panel data have become an increasingly used resource in applied social research. A panel is a group of people who are surveyed periodically over time. Two fundamental types of information can be derived from panel data: cross-sectional information that inform us about the differences between subjects or groups of subjects at a particular moment in time, and time series information that inform us about changes within subjects or groups of subjects over time. Longitudinal studies enable the study of the dynamics of change across the life course and the effects of earlier characteristics on later outcomes. For these reasons panel data have become an increasingly used resource in applied social research. A huge range of secondary datasets are available, many containing education related information. However, some are not widely used by education researchers. This contribution is aimed at encouraging and enabling [early stage] education researchers to exploit the rich resource of panel data available to them, and using the appropriate statistical methods and software programmes."

Quantitative research involves describing \'reality\' through numbers: it isn\'t possible to fully describe the complexity of the world using data, which is why we use models. Models are smaller scale or stripped down representations of reality, or that aspect of reality with which we are concerned. The resource presents models as necessary, useful, and a means of representing reality. Practical guidance is provided on frequency distributions, uses of the mean, median and mode, and ways of developing measures of central tendency. Measures of central tendency and measures of spread are explored."

In this short article Eamonn Kelly and Richard Lesh outline the thinking behind this study and design experiments. \'Design experimentation\' was first used in 1992 by Ann Brown, a US psychologist. She looked to the field of engineering for inspiration on how to conduct experimental research in classrooms, and developed a hybrid cycle of prototyping, classroom field-testing, and laboratory study. In the past decade, the original notion of the design experiment has been transmuted. Now a diverse set of teaching interventions, educational software design projects, and learning environment manipulations are loosely termed \u2018design experiments\u2019, \u2018design studies\u2019, or \u2018teaching experiments\u2019"
