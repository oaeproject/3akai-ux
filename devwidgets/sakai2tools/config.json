     * The Sakai 2 Tools Widget is for all practical cases
     * the same code as the basiclti widget, but with some name
     * space changes and config file changes. Even most of the
     * filenames are still basiclti.*. We may want to refactor 
     * the widgets in the future, but since the Sakai 2 Tools widget
     * is likely to be thrown out when the new add dialog is 
     * implemented for now we are just copying the bltiwidget and
     * changing the namespaces and global symbols.
