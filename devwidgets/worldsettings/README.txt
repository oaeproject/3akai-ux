This directory (3akai-ux/devwidgets/_template) contains a complete set of files
to create a new Sakai OAE widget.

The best way to use these files is:

1) Copy the _template directory to another directory with the id of your new
   widget (i.e. 'mywidget').
   
   i.e. On a *nix system:
   $ cp -r 3akai-ux/devwidgets/_template 3akai-ux/devwidgets/mywidget
   
2) In your new directory, remove the README.txt file and change all occurences
   of worldsettings in filenames and the files themselves to the id of your widget.
   
   After doing this, you should have the following file structure:
   
   devwidgets/mywidget
   devwidgets/mywidget/bundles
   devwidgets/mywidget/bundles/default.properties
   devwidgets/mywidget/config.json
   devwidgets/mywidget/css
   devwidgets/mywidget/css/mywidget.css
   devwidgets/mywidget/javascript
   devwidgets/mywidget/javascript/mywidget.js
   devwidgets/mywidget/mywidget.html
   
   and, you should no longer be able to find occurences of worldsettings within your
   mywidget directory.

3) Configure and build your new widget!
